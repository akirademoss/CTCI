My solutions for select problems in Cracking the Coding Interview

## Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
Question 1.) **Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures.

Question 2.) **Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

Question 3.) **URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)

Question 5.) **One Away:** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.

Question 7.) **Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an MxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

## Chapter 2: Linked Lists

Question 1.) **Remove Dups:** Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

Question 2.) **Return Kth to Last:** Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

Question 3.) **Delete Middle Node:** Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.
